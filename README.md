# sql-challenge

NOTE: All data used are stored in EmployeeSQL

1. Drew the EDR using QuickDBD
-Created tables in a particular order
-For table dept_emp, there were no unique entries for primary key, so composite key has been created

The image is saved in EmployeeSQL folder as EDR image.

2.Exported the codes for postgreSQL
The codes to create schemas are in schemas.sql

3.Worked on the query questions
All the codes for the queries are stored in queries.sql
To answer the queries, I used joins together with sub queries.
Functions used: GROUP BY, ORDER BY
